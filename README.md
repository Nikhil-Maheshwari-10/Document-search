# Document Uploader & Semantic Search

Welcome to the **Document Uploader & Semantic Search** app! This project provides a user-friendly interface for uploading documents (PDF, TXT, CSV, XLSX), extracting their content, and performing powerful semantic search using vector embeddings and Qdrant.

## Features

- üìÑ **Upload Documents:**
  - Supports PDF files only .
  - Extracts text and (optionally) processes images from PDFs.
- üîç **Semantic Search:**
  - Search across all uploaded documents using natural language queries.
  - Retrieves the most relevant text and image descriptions using vector search.
- üß† **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**
  - Uses LLMs to generate answers based on retrieved document context.
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Understanding:**
  - Optionally extracts and describes images from PDFs using an LLM.
- ‚ö° **Fast & Scalable:**
  - Uses Qdrant for efficient vector storage and retrieval.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Clear Storage:**
  - Easily clear all uploaded data and start fresh.

## How It Works

1. **Upload** your documents via the web interface.
2. The app extracts text (and optionally image content) and generates vector embeddings.
3. All embeddings are stored in a Qdrant collection for fast similarity search.
4. Enter a search query to find the most relevant document chunks and image descriptions.
5. The app uses an LLM to generate a detailed answer based on the retrieved context.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file with the following keys:
     ```env
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
     EMBEDDING_MODEL=your_embedding_model_name
     QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333  # or your Qdrant Cloud URL
     QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key  # if using Qdrant Cloud
     ```
4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Upload Section:**
  - Select and upload your documents.
  - Optionally enable/disable image processing for PDFs.
- **Search Section:**
  - Enter your query and click "Search".
  - View the generated answer and the context used.
  - Expand to see relevant document chunks and image descriptions.
- **Clear Storage:**
  - Use the "Clear Storage" button to delete all uploaded data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/)
- [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/), [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/), [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/)
- [litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)

## Notes

- Make sure your Qdrant instance is running and accessible.
- The app uses environment variables for API keys and configuration.
- For image understanding, a compatible LLM (e.g., Gemini) is required.
